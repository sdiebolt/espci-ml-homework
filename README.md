# Machine Learning Module, ESPCI Paris - Final Homework

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook of my final homework for the
*Machine Learning* module at ESPCI Paris.

The notebook doesn't render well on GitHub: it can be rendered online using
nbviewer
[here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiebolt/espci-ml-homework/blob/master/ML%20Module%20%40ESPCI%20-%20Homework.ipynb).
